# Model Consolidation in Flask Application

## Problem
The application had duplicate model definitions across the admin and user modules, causing SQLAlchemy errors:
- `Table 'question' is already defined for this MetaData instance`
- `Table 'essay_response' is already defined for this MetaData instance`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Consolidated Question Model
- Kept the Question model definition in `admin/models/question.py`
- Commented out and deprecated the duplicate definition in `user/models/question.py`
- Updated all imports to use `from admin.models.question import Question`

### 2. Consolidated EssayResponse Model
- Kept the EssayResponse model definition in `admin/models/essay_response.py`
- Commented out and deprecated the duplicate definition in `user/models/essay_response.py`
- Updated all imports to use `from admin.models.essay_response import EssayResponse`

### 3. Updated Import Structure
- Modified `user/models/__init__.py` to import models from admin package
- Updated `user/models.py` proxy to use the consolidated model structure

## Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each model is now defined in only one place
2. **No More SQLAlchemy Errors**: The "table already defined" errors are resolved
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to models only need to be made in one place

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `user/models/__init__.py` - Updated imports to use admin models
2. `user/models/question.py` - Commented out original code, now re-exports admin model
3. `user/models/essay_response.py` - Commented out original code, now re-exports admin model
4. `user/models.py` - Updated import statements to reflect consolidated structure

### Key Pattern Used:
- Convert duplicate model files to "proxy modules" that re-export the models from the canonical location
- Add clear documentation in deprecated files to guide developers

## Next Steps
1. Consider removing the duplicate model files entirely after confirming application stability
2. Apply the same pattern to other duplicated models if found
3. Consider organizing models in a dedicated `models` package at the application root level to avoid future duplication
