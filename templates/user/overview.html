    <p>Welcome to RiddleNet! This is a simple web application that demonstrates how to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) using Flask and PyOTP. You can sign up for an account, log in, and view your profile. The application uses a secret key to generate a one-time password (OTP) that you can use to authenticate yourself. You can also generate a QR code that you can scan with a 2FA app like Google Authenticator or Authy.</p>
    
    <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>The system consists of several key components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users can sign up and log in using their credentials. The system uses hashed passwords for security.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> After logging in, users are required to enter a one-time password (OTP) generated by a 2FA app. This adds an extra layer of security.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Management:</strong> Users can update their profile information, including their username, password, and profile image.</li>
        <li><strong>Quiz Functionality:</strong> Users can participate in quizzes, and their scores are saved and displayed on a leaderboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> The leaderboard displays the highest scores of all users, along with the date of their last attempt.</li>
        <li><strong>Score Management:</strong> Users can view and delete their past quiz scores.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the system works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Users create an account by providing a username and password. The password is hashed and stored securely in the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Log In:</strong> Users log in using their credentials. If the credentials are correct, they are prompted to enter an OTP generated by their 2FA app.</li>
        <li><strong>Generate QR Code:</strong> When a user signs up, a secret key is generated and used to create a QR code. The user scans this QR code with their 2FA app to set up 2FA.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify OTP:</strong> During login, the user enters the OTP from their 2FA app. The system verifies the OTP and grants access if it is correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> After logging in, users are redirected to the dashboard where they can start quizzes, view their profile, and check the leaderboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Quiz Participation:</strong> Users can start a quiz, answer questions, and submit their answers. The system calculates their score and saves it in the database.</li>
        <li><strong>View and Delete Scores:</strong> Users can view their past quiz scores and delete any score they wish to remove.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Crimping Simulation</h2>
    <p>The UTP Cable Crimping Simulation allows users to practice crimping cables virtually. Users can select the wiring type (Straight-Through or Crossover), drag and drop wires into the correct slots, and check their wiring.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Wiring Type:</strong> Choose between Straight-Through (T568B) or Crossover (T568A to T568B).</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange Wires:</strong> Drag and drop the wires into the correct slots for both ends of the cable.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Wiring:</strong> Click the "Crimp the Cable" button to verify the wiring. If correct, a success message is displayed; otherwise, users can try again.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Network Topology</h2>
    <p>The Network Topology tool allows users to create and verify different network topologies. Users can drag and drop devices onto a canvas, connect them, and check if the topology is correct.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Topology:</strong> Choose a topology from the dropdown menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Drag and Drop Devices:</strong> Drag devices from the palette to the canvas.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect Devices:</strong> Click "Connection Mode" and connect devices by clicking on them.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Topology:</strong> Click "Check Topology" to verify if the created topology matches the selected one.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Network Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
    <p>The Network Troubleshooting Guide helps users learn how to troubleshoot common network issues. Users can select a problem, drag and drop devices, and simulate troubleshooting scenarios.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Problem:</strong> Choose a network problem from the dropdown menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Drag and Drop Devices:</strong> Drag devices from the palette to the canvas.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect Devices:</strong> Click "Connection Mode" and connect devices by clicking on them.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Scenario:</strong> Click "Check Scenario" to verify if the setup addresses the selected problem.</li>
    </ol>
